<b> Important note: </b><br/>
BinGoog is written for Chrome, so download a chromedriver.exe that corresponds to the same version as your Chrome web browser and copy it in the directory of "BinGoog.exe". The webdriver uploaded here is for Chrome 87. 


<b>Terms and condition:</b><br/>
Use this app to collect images for your deep learning projects but do not scrape more than 10 keywords per hour. I have slowed down the app to allow you complete 6-8 successful scrape per hour. If you try to scrape more keywords using the same ip address, google/bing may block your ip address. I do not take any responsibility if your ip is blocked by any or all search engines.

<b>Fixed bugs in V1.0.1:</b><br/>
-Timeout is added while requesting image links to avoid early freezes.
