To use Selenium web driver, not only you should install Selenium library in Python, but also you should download the driver that corresponds to your browser name and version. For example, by navigating to Help>About in chrome you can find its version. Mine was 86.0.4240.75. So I downloaded "chromedirver" and copied it in the directory that I have these codes.
